# Banks-Search-Application
Bank Search Application for Fyle

Backend Coding Test

You need to create a REST service that can fetch bank details, using the data given in the APIâ€™s query parameters. 

You can use the data available in this repository in your backend DB. Write your service in any language of your choice. Host it on Heroku - you can signup for a free account in Heroku. E.g. Here are steps on how you can get a Django app running in Heroku in a few minutes. Please use PostgreSQL as your backend DB. Since the free-tier of Heroku has a limit of 10k rows, you can use another DB provider (eg: you can use clever-cloud.com to host your Postgres DB by following steps). 

Essentials your applications should have: 
Autocomplete API to return possible matches based on the branch name ordered by IFSC code (ascending order) with limit and offset.
Endpoint: /api/branches/autocomplete?q=<>
Example: /api/branches/autocomplete?q=RTGS&limit=3&offset=0
Sample response: 
{
 "branches": [{
   "ifsc": "ABHY0065001",
